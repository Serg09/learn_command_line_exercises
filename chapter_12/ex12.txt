Coding in Ruby

I've got a copy of Camel 2
Oh Perl we love you, and regex too
I post to clpm and there's nothing else to do
Ruby is published
With O'Reilly, wow
The code is simple
And in English now
I often read the FAQ when no one else's around
I've got your tarball, I've got your tarball
I'm milling over installing it myself
I asked the admin to install the tarball
So I can run you from in the firewall as well
You've got me returning refs, returning meths
return "" is true when I think its false

[Chorus]
I'm coding in Ruby
I think I'm coding in Ruby
I really think so
Coding in Ruby
I think I'm coding in Ruby
It doesn't seem slow
I'm coding in Ruby
I think I'm coding in Ruby
I really think so
Coding in Ruby
I think I'm coding in Ruby
Can I get a job? No.

No cruft, no my, no whining, no MarsNeedsWomen.pm
No FWP, no sin(), no strict, no wonder it's hard
All the code around me is a total disaster
All the jobs avoid me like a psycho coder
Everyone

[Chorus]


Original song	Turning Japanese
Original artist	The Vapors
Filk author	Michael G Schwern
Intro	With endless apologies to everyone involved.
