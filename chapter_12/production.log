Production Logging
 	
Standard
Production Logging Tools
During production or injection profiling, a wide range of production logging tools are used for all type of downhole environments in  vertical, deviated, and horizontal wells. Standard Production Logging tools are completely modular and combinable with Array Production Logging sensors to provide accurate measurements of flow velocity, gas hold up, fluid velocity and other auxiliary measurements. These tools are conveyance independent and can be run in real time with E-line or in Memory Production Logging (MPL) mode with similar data quality

Flow Velocity Measurements 
Continuous flow meters, basket flow meters, full-bore flow meters and Inline Flow meters

Fluid Identification / Flow Composition Measurements
Gas holdup, capacitance water holdup, radioactive fluid density, differential pressure density, capacitance array

Flow Condition / Well Diagnostic Tools
Pressure, temperature, X-Y caliper, inclinometer correlation tools – gamma ray, casing collar locator

 	 
 	
High Deviation - Horizontal Well
Production Array Logging

Center-Sampling Tools Misdiagnose Horizontal Wells In vertical wells, oil, gas and water remain uniformly distributed across the wellbore. However, when wells deviate more than 20 degrees from vertical, ﬂuids begin to separate into their own streams and move at diverent rates. Lighter ﬂuids move along the high side of the well, while heavier ﬂuids flow along the low side.

Analyzing Flow Rates, Volumes, Fluid Entry/Exit Points

In these conditions, standard center-sampling devices cannot accurately quantify distributions and velocities. They produce incorrect volume estimates and misdiagnose ﬂuid entry or exit points. This makes it difcult to optimize production.

The problem becomes worse as wells approach the horizontal section of a well and their paths begin to undulate. Finding the source of water production with center-sampling tools in these conditions can be diffcult or impossible. Due to the tool’s location in the wellbore, the sensor may not ﬁnd the ﬂuid in the zone that’s producing it.

 	 
 	
Memory Production Logging (MPLSM) Service
Production Logging with Electric Line Accuracy, Slickline Economy

Halliburton's Memory Production Logging (MPLSM) ) service overcomes challenges at the wellsite by employing downhole memory to record accurate flow profiles and diagnostics - then playing back its captured data after tools are retrieved from the well. Rigged with slickline, the MPL service minimizes risk in environments challenged by CO2, H2S, or high pressures. The tool can also be deployed on coiled tubing for highly deviated or horizontal wells.

Because the MPL service can use existing slickline equipment, operators avoid the expense of mobilizing a specialized logging unit. And by using Halliburton's advanced slickline depth measurement system (AMS), operators can lower the risk of misruns that can waste valuable rig time for little or no gain.
