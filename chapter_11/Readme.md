# "English" questions:
### Can you rename foo.txt to blah.txt?
> To rename **foo.txt** file to **blah.txt** I would first create a **foo.txt** file in my chapter_11 directory.
> Then I would use command:

      mv foo.txt blah.txt
      
### Can you move the production.log file in the log directory to slash temp?
> First I would create a **log** directory in the **chapter_11** directory using command:

      mkdir log
      
> then in log directory create a file **production.log** using command:

      touch production.log
      
> Now I can run command:

      mv production.log /tmp
      
> which moves the file. And to check if command done properly I would run command:

      ls /tmp
      
> The file **production.log** is in the **/tmp** directory.
