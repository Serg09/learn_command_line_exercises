What is your shell set to?

To find what my shell set to I would run command

The output: ```/bin/bash```

What directory are you in (don't use pwd this time)?

To see directory I am in I would use command:

```echo $PWD```

The output: ```/Users/viola_lv/workspace/davinci_coders_t3_2015/homework/learn_command_line_exercises```


What is your home directory set to?

Can you set your environment to have DEBUG set to true?

To find correct command, first I would use Help to find out needed commands and parameters:

```man env```

Then I would run command:

```env -i debug=on```

to turn on debugging.
