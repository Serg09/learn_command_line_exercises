To make this exercise, in newly created chapter_5 I have created the same directories as in chapter_4 ~/temp/stuff/things/frank/joe/alex/john

•	cd to the joe directory with one command.
cd temp/stuff/things/frank/joe/
•	cd back to temp with one command, but not further above that.
cd ../../../../
•	Find out how to cd to your "home directory" with one command.
cd
pwd /Users/viola_lv/
•	cd to your Documents directory, then find it with your GUI file browser (Finder, Windows Explorer, etc.).
cd Documents (used tab to make it faster): 
Finder – Documents (in Favorites)
•	cd to your Downloads directory, then find it with your file browser.
cd ..     cd Downloads
Finder – Downloads (in Favorites)
•	Find another directory with your file browser, then cd to it.
Finder – Desktop: cd ..      cd Desktop/
•	Remember when you put quotes around a directory with spaces in it? You can do that with any command. For example, if you have a directory I Have Fun, then you can do: cd "I Have Fun"
Got it


Cd temp
Cd temp
Cd /tmp
Cd /tmp/log

The cd command is used to change the working directory. (sorry, did not clearly understood the last quastion)
