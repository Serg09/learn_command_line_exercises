### Can you output all the txt files in this directory?
To output all txt files in the directory I would run command:

```ls -l *.txt```
      
The output shows me all txt files:

      -rw-r--r--  1 viola_lv  staff  39 Sep 26 22:20 bigfile.txt
      -rw-r--r--  1 viola_lv  staff  13 Sep 26 22:20 ex12.txt
      -rw-r--r--  1 viola_lv  staff  13 Sep 26 22:20 ex13.txt
      -rw-r--r--  1 viola_lv  staff  13 Sep 26 22:20 ex14.txt
      -rw-r--r--  1 viola_lv  staff  78 Oct  4 08:55 uncool.txt

### Show me the content of the text files in slash temp?
To show txt files in /tmp directory I would run command:

```ls -l /tmp/*.txt```
      
The output shows me all txt files in /tmp directory:

      -rw-r--r--  1 viola_lv  wheel  0 Oct  4 07:31 /tmp/foo.txt
