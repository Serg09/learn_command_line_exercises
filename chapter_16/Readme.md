### Can you output all the txt files in this directory?
To output all content of txt files in the current directory I would run command:

```cat *.txt > dir_txt.txt```
      
On the output I will have ```dir_txt.txt``` file with the content of txt files in current directory:

### Show me the content of the text files in slash temp?
To show txt files content in /tmp directory I would run command:

```at /tmp/*.txt > tmp_txt.txt```
      
The output will have ```tmp_txt.txt``` with all content of txt files from /tmp directory.
