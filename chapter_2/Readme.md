I typed pwd command in the newly created directory chapter_2. The pwd command gave me a link working directory which is /Users/viola_lv/workspace/davinci_coders_t3_2015/homework/learn_command_line_exercises/chapter_2.
In this directory I also created file Readme.md using command touch Readme.md.
Find this directory and file in graphical file browser. It was easy to find and
it was what I have created. Open Finder - in Favorites click on my homedirectory - workspace - davinci_coders_t3_2015 - homework - learn_command_line_exercises - chapter_2 - Readme.md
