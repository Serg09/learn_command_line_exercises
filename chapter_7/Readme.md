Did 20 directories under chapter_6/tmp directory. Used mkdir command to create them. Than used rmdir [dir] to remove directory
Created one path with 10 deep directories using mkdir â€“p [dir tree] and than delete each directory from the last one.
I can remove tmp directory in chapter_6. But I can not delete system tmp directory because of permission and/or that directory is not empty.
